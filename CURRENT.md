# Current Objective

## Objective

Continue evidence-backed W3D material decoding with shaders, textures, and UV references
on top of verified static geometry and diffuse colors.

## Implemented foundation

- R0 completion suite passed in GitHub CI run `29840005186`.
- Rust workspace and CI policy.
- Bounded, cursor-based binary reads with structured errors.
- Normalized, ASCII case-insensitive virtual paths.
- Deterministic last-mounted-wins overlays with full provider history.
- Loose-directory manifest CLI and synthetic tests.
- Evidence-backed `BIGF`/`BIG4` indexing with explicit limits and synthetic fixture.
- BIG duplicate-name history with deterministic last-entry-wins resolution.
- Mixed directory/BIG manifests through `cic-inspect`.
- Evidence-backed CSF version 3 decoding with raw names, complemented UTF-16, optional
  wave names, zero-string labels, and all variants preserved.
- Deterministic `cic-inspect csf` reports through loose-directory or BIG mounts.
- Original CSF fixture and synthetic BIG-to-CSF CLI completion artifact.
- Bounded W3D chunk-tree inventory with opaque unknown payload preservation, stable
  slash-separated tree paths, and 73 known chunk names.
- Deterministic `cic-inspect w3d` reports through loose-directory or BIG mounts.
- Original nested W3D fixture and synthetic BIG-to-W3D CLI completion artifact.
- Local formatting, strict Clippy, and all 45 runtime tests pass.
- All 18 installed Steam Generals BIG archives have matching declared sizes and bounded
  verified directory trailers; `INI.big` resolves 92 deterministic manifest entries.
- The installed Steam Generals CSF parses exactly to its 282,246-byte member boundary and
  reports version 3, 2,806 labels, and 2,805 strings.
- A 113,980-byte installed Steam Generals W3D parses exactly into 525 stable inventory
  records; 12 sampled W3Ds use the documented container flag.
- The CSF AddressSanitizer/libFuzzer smoke gate completed 4,077,155 inputs in 31 seconds
  without a crash or sanitizer finding.
- Header3 versions 3.0 through 4.2, vertices, normals, and triangles decode into immutable,
  renderer-neutral values with explicit 4,000,000-record limits.
- Static meshes require exact count-sized payloads, mandatory static channels, unique data
  chunks, and in-range triangle indices.
- The original three-vertex/one-triangle fixture and BIG-backed `cic-inspect w3d-mesh`
  completion artifact pass; reports preserve floating-point values as exact bits.
- One installed version 4.2 mesh verified at 24 vertices, 24 normals, and 12 triangles.
- Deterministic geometry-only Wavefront OBJ export preserves coordinates, normals, triangle
  order, and winding; the installed verification mesh exported as 24 vertices, 24 normals,
  and 12 faces.
- Material inventories, 32-byte vertex materials, singleton/per-vertex first-pass IDs, and
  explicit DCG arrays decode into immutable values with count, size, name, scalar, and index
  validation.
- First-pass DCG colors override vertex-material diffuse colors; colored OBJ exports append
  normalized RGB values to vertex records.
- Original colored-triangle and synthetic BIG-backed completion artifacts pass. Two
  installed static meshes decode their material inventories and assignments directly from
  the user-owned W3D archive.

## Known blockers

- `BIG4` remains implemented from corroborating source but unverified against retail data.
- W3D shader records, texture names/info, per-pass shader/texture IDs, and texture-coordinate
  references require the next evidence-backed semantic specification.

## Next verified step

Specify shaders, texture names/info, pass shader/texture IDs, and UV arrays with their
index/count invariants; then emit OBJ texture coordinates and material references without
introducing rendering dependencies.
